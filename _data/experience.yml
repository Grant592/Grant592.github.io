    My main achievements within my role include -   
    * Moved all data reporting from excel based sheets to an online Dash based web app hosted on Heroku and moved data storage and management to a MySQL server hosted on AWS.  
    * Introduced dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA) to simplify how we monitor and feedback player training load  and wellbeing. This not only improved the intepretability of data for coaches and players but also helped us identify the individual athlete risk factors which were not necessarily visible from the original data and resulted in a reduction in the number of time loss injuries.  
    * Used SVD to create individual athlete ’fingerprints’ to track and monitor performance over time  
    * Designed and built a custom made hamstring force testing device using load cells, arduino circuit boards and wrote the software in python using PyQt.  
    * Using raw player GPS data, transformed the data into rolling worst case scenario periods to aid the rugby coaches in  achieveing training intensities above that of match intensities.
